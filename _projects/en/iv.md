The project stems from the need to help people with psychiatric disorders learn to recognize facial expressions that represent emotions. These people could benefit from a game in which they can train their skills in recognizing facial expressions. The idea behind the project is to generate images that can be used in the game. These images can be caricatures, 3D models or photographs depending on the difficulty. For example, the person can choose the photo of a relative to be used in the game. The game will be able to modify this photo so that it has the facial expression of the emotion of anger. Then the player must identify the emotion which emotion is being expressed in the photo.
