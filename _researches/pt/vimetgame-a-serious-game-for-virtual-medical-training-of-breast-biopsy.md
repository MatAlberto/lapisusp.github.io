Serious games can provide an attractive way for training procedures. Some applications for simulating training in the health area are available, but most of them do not include ludic aspects. ViMeTGame simulate breast biopsy exam using Virtual Reality. Immersive aspects were included to increase users engagement. Ludic aspects increase motivation for playing, haptic device was suitable for interaction, colors and illumination techniques were appropriate to provide visual realism and this type of application can present a successful use among students.
